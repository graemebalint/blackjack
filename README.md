The Blackjack card game, aka 21

Live demo: https://replit.com/@GraemeBalint/blackjack?v=1

**Instructions**:

1. Open the live demo link and click the **green run** button (its slow, takes about 5 seconds after clicking the button). Follow the on-screen prompts.

**Project goals:**
1. This was 1 of my first Python projects. The game logic and requirements were not provided, so a major challenge was to actually think through the game design, define the requirements, and implement the logic.
